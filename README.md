# How To Play
1. Player 1 will play first
2. Click roll to get your dice number, and the number will be added to CURRENT BOX as a temporary score
3. You can roll the dice again to get more point in CURRENT BOX
4. If you get number 1 the CURRENT score will be 0, and the next turn will be the other player's turn
5. The win condition is if one of the player's SCORE is more than 100
